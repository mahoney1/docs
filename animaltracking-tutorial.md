## Introduction

This tutorial aims to show how to integrate data and events from a blockchain ledger, into a client-side React Dashboard app. The tutorial provides the end-to-end steps to render the data and events, into a fictitious animal co-operative dashboard app, providing summary charts, tables and then query and event data sourced from a local Hyperledger Fabric runtime blockchain. We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code developer extension to start a Fabric, and invoke some sample transactions to create data. We'll also start an Event Listener, still within the extension and finally, launch the application, which will automatically render the new data in tables within the dashboard application.

**Figure 1. "CONGA Co-op" -- overview of Animal Tracking sample network and client interaction**

![Transaction flow](images/flow-overview.png)

The tutorial uses an 'intermediate' model-based Typescript contract and is aimed at Developers who wish to understand how to integrate blockchain data into a sample application, in this case a React-based application based on (Tabler UI React-based Dashboard)[https://github.com/tabler/tabler-react]. Take time to see what's going on - you don't necessarily have to understand Typescript, Javascript or React in great detail to understand this !  The lifecycle of typical transactions contained in the animal tracking contract is shown below.

![Typical contract transaction lifecycle](images/animaltracking.png)

We'll also be using the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode Extension - and the new Fabric programming model and SDK features under the covers - to complete these tasks. In particular, you will use Query and Event Typescript application clients - in addition to the IBP VS Code extension, to perform the required actions in this tutorial.


## Background
This sample Typescript smart contract and accompanying React-based dashboard for the basis for showing end-to-end integration, from user interacting with an application client, to adding transactions, updating a blockchain ledger and querying the ledger to render results (whether aggregated summaries, filtered queries or listening for events) in a local application. The use case is an Animal Co-operative dashboard, which required the truth to be sourced from the ledger.

## Pre-requisites

1. You will need to have the following installed in order to use the extension:

* (Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater)[https://nodejs.org/en/download/]
* (Yeoman (yo) v2.x)[https://yeoman.io/]
* (Docker version v17.06.2-ce or greater)[https://www.docker.com/get-started]
* (Docker Compose v1.14.0 or greater)[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/]
* VS Code â€” see the (marketplace)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform] for the minimum version to install

2. For Part 2 of this tutorial - deploying and integrating the dashboard App and smart contract to IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS - you will need to have an (IBM Blockchain Platform blockchain network)[https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/blockchain] installed and running.

## Preparatory Steps

31. From a Terminal window, create a project directory (as a non-root user on Linux) called `dash`   eg assume `$HOME/dash` is the starting point 

`cd $HOME/dash` to enter that directory

2. Clone the `tabler-react` Github repository:

`git clone https://github.com/tabler/tabler-react.git`

3. Clone the `animaltracking` Github repository:

`git clone https://github.com/mahoney1/animaltracking.git`

4. IF you've previously deployed the `animal-tracking` smart contract, would suggest to perform a `teardown` in the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension (click on the icon) in VS Code - then select 'FABRIC OPS', click in the '...'  select 'TearDown Runtime Fabric' and confirm you want to tear down. After doing a teardown, start a new Fabric, again from 'FABRIC OPS' .....click on 'Start New Fabric' and ensure that you have a running, functional Fabric, and with the Nodes started, in the left sidepanel.

5. In VSCode, connect to your local Fabric Gateway under the 'Fabric Gateways' sidepanel, and use the`admin` identity to connect.

6. In VSCode Explorer, choose File > Open Folder, and navigate to the `animaltracking` folder in your cloned repo - then select the `contracts` folder, eg. navigating to the `$HOME/animaltracking/contract` directory. The `contract` folder must be your top-level project folder in VSCode before proceeding

7. Click on the IBM Blockchain Platform icon and from '...' ellipses on the 'Smart Contract Packages' panel, choose to 'Package a Smart Contract' - choose `animaltracking@0.0.1`. You should get confirmation the package was successfully created.

8. Next, under 'Local Fabric Ops' choose to 'Install' the package onto the local peer - await a successful install message in VS Code.

9. Next, instantiate the `animaltracking` Smart Contract by choosing 'Instantiate'  and when prompted, select `animaltracking@0.0.1` as the contract to instantiate. 

    - When prompted to provide a function, supply the text:
      `org.example.animaltracking:instantiate` 
      and hit ENTER.
    - Hit ENTER to accept the remaining defaults for the remaining parameters when prompted. 
    
In approx. one minute or less, you should get confirmation the contract was successfully instantiated and you should see the instantiated contract called `animaltracking@xxx`, under the 'Fabric Local Ops' pane.

Successful completion of these pre-reqs, is the basis from which this tutorial can now  proceed. 

## Estimated time

After the prerequisites are completed, this should take approximately *45-60 minutes* to complete.

## Scenario

Jane Pearson has been at CONGA Co-op for 10 years now, and of late, she has taken on a very special role: she is responsible for keeping a handle on the SHEEPGOAT numbers, as they are a rare species (super-evolutionary in fact: they don't need any vaccines, tetanus jabs, immune to diseases, that affect their cousins!). Jane needs key stats about SHEEPGOATS at her fingertips. Part of her remit is to monitor events affecting SHEEPGOATS in the co-op region, be they 'green' events like new registrations, or more critical ones such as quarantined SHEEPGOATs and needs to know they are imminently being inspected by a Farm Vet.

Jane relies heavily on her dashboard app, in particular the events, from which she can instigate actions.

OK, lets get started !

## Steps

### Step 1. Pre-populate the ledger with some demo records

1.  In IBP in the VSCode extension, expand the `animaltracking@xxx` contract under 'Fabric Gateways'. You will see a list of transactions. Scroll down to the end and you will find a transaction called `setupdemo`. We'll use this to pre-populate the ledger with some sample data.

2. Right-click on `setupdemo` and select `Submit Transaction` - accept all the default prompts for parameters etc - we won't need to supply any parameters.

### Step 2. Start the Contract Event Listener in the VS Code terminal window

1. Still in VS Code, click on `Terminal1` at the bottom - press ENTER if prompted to `hit any key to close`. You should now have a command prompt - change directory to the animaltracking `client` directory from the current `contract` subdirectory:

`cd ../client/lib`

2. Start the local Event Listener by running the bash script `listenLocal.sh`:

`./listenLocal.sh`

You should get messages ("Getting Listener" etc) that its started and you should also see an event from the earlier `setupdemo` transaction (it registers some demo animals: there will be an event for a SHEEPGOAT registration).

### Step 3. Invoke Transactions in sequence through the IBP VS Code extension

1. Go back to the list of `animaltracking` transactions under 'Fabric Gateways' and right-click on `register` ... `Submit Transaction`.  When prompted, paste the following parameter list - including the double-quotes "" : in between the two square brackets `[ ]` in the VS Code prompt: 

`"SHEEPGOAT 000011 24/07/2019 BOVIS_ARIES FARMER.JOHN AVONDALE.LOC1 ARRIVALF1 IN_FIELD WOOL false"`
 
2. Click on the adjacent Terminal in VS Code and check that we had an event reported by the Event Listener for id `000011` .

3. Go back to the transaction list - this time, right-click on `quarantine` ... `Submit Transaction` . When prompted: paste these 2 parameters (each separated by double-quotes), in between the square brackets at the parameters prompt:

`"SHEEPGOAT", "000011"`

4. Once again, check from the terminal window that you've got an `ISOLATION` event posted.

5. Lastly, select the transaction `assigninspection` ... `Submit Transaction` . When prompted, paste the following into the square brackets:

`"SHEEPGOAT", "000011", "VET00007"`

6. Once again, check the Event Listener pane - we should have an INSPECT event reported.


**Figure 2. Open the commercial paper sample project in VSCode**
  ![Open the commercial paper sample project in VSCode](images/papercontract.png)
  
2.  Open the main contract script file `papercontract.js` under the `lib` folder - add the following lines as instructed below:

After the  `const { Contract, Context }` line (approx line 8),  add the following lines:

```
// Tutorial specific 'require' for reporting identity of transactor using the Client Identity Chaincode Library (CID)

const ClientIdentity = require('fabric-shim').ClientIdentity;
```

This library is to enable us to obtain the invoker or identity submitting each transaction in our commercial paper lifecycle. It is done for reporting purposes, when we render the invoking identity information in a browser app, later on in the tutorial.

3. After the `// PaperNet specific classes ` line (approx line 16) add another class declaration as follows:

```
const QueryUtils = require('./query.js');
```

don't worry about any errors reported under 'Problems' (if you have ESLint enabled) in the status bar for now. 


4. Still in `papercontract.js`, find the function that begins `async issue` (approx line 70) and scroll down to the line `paper.setOwner(issuer);` in the function - create a blank/new line directly under it (should align with the correct indentation in your code).

5. Now paste in the following code block: The following code enables us to report the true identity of the transaction. The function `idGen` below is a class based function in `papercontract.js` ,  that uses the Client Identity Chaincode Library (CID) to obtain the attribute containing the invoking id (from its X509 Certificate).

```
    // Add the invoking CN, to the Paper state
    let invokingId = await this.idGen(ctx);
    paper.setCreator(invokingId);
    
```
Note: this code should be located BEFORE the line `await ctx.paperList.addPaper(paper);` in the `issue` function.

6. Repeat the paste as shown above (ie the 3 line block)  - into the functions beginning with 
   - `async buy` and 
   - `async redeem` 
   
   Paste the 3 line code block, near the end of EACH of those functions - and BEFORE the following line shown in each function : `await ctx.paperList.updatePaper(paper);`

7. In the `async buy` function only - at line 120 (approx) in the code, eg line with comment `// Check paper is not already REDEEMED` -  ADD this single line of code, BELOW the line `paper.setOwner(newOwner);` but INSIDE the `isTrading()`  code 'branch':

```
paper.setPrice(price);
```

8.  Next, add the following code block, containing the 3 functions below (two of which are our 'callable' query transaction functions), directly AFTER the CLOSING curly bracket of the `redeem` transaction function,  but must be BEFORE - the last CLOSING bracket in the file `papercontract.js` (ie the one immediately before the `module.exports` declaration) . These 2 main query functions call the 'worker' query functions / iterators in the file `query.js` and the `idGen` function below gets identity information, used for reporting):

```
   /**
    * grab the invoking CN from the of the X509 transactor cert
    * @param {Context} ctx the transaction context
    */

    async idGen(ctx)     {
 
        // Use the Client Identity Chaincode Library (CID) to get the invoker info.
        let cid = new ClientIdentity(ctx.stub);
        let id = cid.getID(); // X509 Certificate invoker is in CN form
        let CN = id.substring(id.indexOf("CN=") + 3, id.lastIndexOf("::"));
        return CN;
    }


    /**
    * queryHist commercial paper
    * @param {Context} ctx the transaction context
    * @param {String} issuer commercial paper issuer
    * @param {Integer} paperNumber paper number for this issuer
    */
    async queryHist(ctx, issuer, paperNumber) {

        // Get a key to be used for History query
        let cpKey = CommercialPaper.makeKey([issuer, paperNumber]);
        let myObj = new QueryUtils(ctx, 'org.papernet.commercialpaperlist');
        let results = await myObj.getHistory(cpKey);
        //console.log('main: queryHist was called and returned ' + JSON.stringify(results) );
        return results;

    }


    /**
    * queryOwner commercial paper
    * @param {Context} ctx the transaction context
    * @param {String} issuer commercial paper issuer
    * @param {Integer} paperNumber paper number for this issuer
    */
    async queryOwner(ctx, owner, paperNumber) {

        // Get a key to be used for the paper, and get this from world state
        // let cpKey = CommercialPaper.makeKey([issuer, paperNumber]);
        let myObj = new QueryUtils(ctx, 'org.papernet.commercialpaperlist');
        let owner_results = await myObj.queryKeyByOwner(owner);
        
        return owner_results;
    } 
 
 ```
    
Note: once you've pasted this into VSCode, the `ESLinter` extension - ie if it is enabled in your VSCode session, may report problems in the `Problems` pane at the bottom. If so, you can easily rectify the formatting issues by in the problems pane by choosing `right-click....` then  `Fix all auto-fixable issues` - likewise, it will remove all trailing spaces if any are reported by ESLint (ie. the line number is reported). Once you've completed the formatting task, save your file, via the menu, save your edits ! (you can hit 'CONTROL and S' as a shortcut to save your file). FYI: The ESLint extension (also available from the VSCode extension marketplace) is a very useful too and I'd recommend using it to fix any indentation, incorrect pasting or general errors that can be detected before you package up the smart contract.
 
9. We have two more small functions to add - this time, inside the source file `paper.js`. Open the file `paper.js` under the `lib` directory in your VSCode session.
 
10. AFTER the existing `setOwner(newOwner)` function  (at approx. line 40) - and under the description called `//basic setters and getters`  - ADD the following code block (contains two functions):

```
    setCreator(creator) {
        this.creator = creator;
    }
    setPrice(price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

```

Next hit CONTROL + S to save the file. 

### Step 2. Add requisite 'worker' Query class functions into your VSCode project - New file: query.js 

1. Create a new file via the VSCode menu,  under the `contract/lib` folder using VSCode - call it `query.js`

2. Copy the contents of the file `query.js` from the Github repo `github.com/mahoney1/commpaper` that you cloned earlier.

3. Paste the contents into your `query.js` VSCode edit session - you should have all the copied contents in your new query javascript 'worker' `query.js` file. Go ahead and save this file ! This ends the smart contract edits.

Let's move on to getting this added smart contract functionality, out on the blockchain, to replace the older smart contract edition!

### Step 3. Upgrade our Smart Contract version using IBP VSCode Extension

1. We now need to add a version change to the `package.json` file in our project - in preparation for the contract upgrade. Click on the `package.json` file in Explorer, and:

  - change the `version` to "0.0.2" 
  - hit CONTROL and S to save it.

2. Click on the Source Control sidebar icon and click the `tick` icon to commit, with a message of 'adding queries' and hit ENTER.

We're now ready to upgrade our smart contract, using the IBP VSCode extension. 

3. Firstly, package the contract - click on the `IBM Blockchain Platform` sidebar icon and under 'Smart Contract Packages' choose to 'Add new package' icon ('+')  and you'll see that version '0.0.2' becomes the latest edition of available `papercontract' packages.

4. Next, upgrade the contract itself: expand the 'Blockchain Connections' pane below, under the channel `mychannel` choose `peer0.org1.example.com` . Expand the `peer0.org1.example.com` twisty and select the `papercontract@0.0.1` entry specifically.  (You will notice also, that all of our transaction functions are listed below (expand the 'twisty' to view), including the new query functions we added).

5. Now choose right-click on `papercontract@0.0.1`...'Upgrade Smart Contract', and choose "papercontract@0.0.2" from the list presented (up top). 

  - Enter or paste the text `org.papernet.commercialpaper:instantiate` when prompted to enter `a function name to call` and hit ENTER ; 
  - Hit 'ENTER' - ie leave blank - when prompted to enter arguments
 
 **Figure 3. Upgrade the smart contract using IBP VScode extension**
 ![Upgrade the smart contract using IBP VScode extension](images/upgrade-contract.png)
 
You should get a message in the console that the upgrade is taking place. It will take a minute or so (please note, as it has to build the new smart contract container) and will display a 'successful' pop message when it has completed. When checked using `docker ps` from a terminal, it will show a new docker container with the contract version as a suffix under the 'Names' column.


### Step 4. Create a new DigiBank query client app, to invoke query transactions

1. In VSCode, click on the menu option 'File....open Folder' and open the folder under `organization/digibank/application` and hit ENTER

2. Right-click on the folder in the left pane and create a new file `queryapp.js` , then paste the contents of the file `queryapp.js` located in the `commercial-paper` repo directory, that you copied from 'Step 5' (eg from `$HOME/commpaper/queryapp.js` ) in the previous Commercial Paper tutorial.

3. Once pasted, you fix any formatting errors, if ESLint is enabled (right-click `Fix all auto-fixable errors` and it should automatically fix all the indentation issues).

4. Hit CONTROL and S to save the file, then click on the `Source Control` icon to commit the file, with a commit message. The `queryapp.js` client contains two query functions:

    - a `queryHist` function that gets the history of a Commercial paper instance and 
    - a `queryOwner` function that gets the list of Commercial Papers owned by an organization (provided as a parameter to the query function).

Next up, we'll create the transaction history, then run the new query client app to execute a set of queries, from a terminal window (from a terminal window in DigiBank's application folder - it does not matter whether we test from Magnetocorp or DigiBank in this example - we should see the same data on the ledger from either application client :-)).


### Step 5. Perform transactions 'issue', 'buy' and 'redeem' to update the ledger

Lets create some transactions, invoked as different identities/invokees and update the world state/create a transaction history on the ledger.  The sequence is:

1. Issue a paper as 'MagnetoCorp'
2. Buy the paper as 'DigiBank' - the new owner
3. Buy the paper as 'Hedgematic' - changed owner 
4. Redeem the paper at face value - as existing owner 'Hedgematic' - with MagnetoCorp as the original issuer

Note that you will have installed any application NodeJS dependencies (`npm install`) for the existing client applications, from the previous tutorial. We will also make use of the existing identity wallets previously populated in that tutorial (these are located at the same level as `application` under both the `magnetocorp` and `digibank` subdirectories respectively.

**Figure 4. "Papernet" -- overview of transaction flow**

![Transaction flow](images/flow-transaction.png)


#### Transaction #1: Execute an `issue` transaction as Isabella@MagnetoCorp

1. Open a terminal window, and change directory to MagnetoCorp's application directory (assuming $HOME is the holding location below):

`cd $HOME/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/application`

2. Now execute the first Commercial paper transaction from the `application` directory - the 'issue' transaction:

`node issue.js`

You should get messages confirming it was successful:

**Figure 5. The "issue" transaction**
![The issue transaction](images/issue-output.png)

#### Transaction #2: Execute a `buy` transaction as Balaji@DigiBank

1. In the same terminal window, change directory to DigiBank's application directory:

`cd ../../digibank/application`

2. Now execute the first Commercial Paper  'buy' transaction from the `application` directory:

`node buy.js`

You should get messages confirming it was successful:

**Figure 6. The "buy" transaction**
![The "buy" transaction](images/buy-output.png)

#### Transaction #3: Execute another `buy` transaction as Bart@Hedgematic

DigiBank are re-structuring their investment portfolio, and have decided to sell on the commercial paper for a small profit to release funds earlier. The purchaser is 'Hedgematic' who see this as an opportunity to increase their commercial paper portfolio and seek to recoup the face value of the paper at some point in the future. Let's execute this transaction as an employee of Hedgematic. (For convenience, we've provided a temporary wallet for the Hedgematic employee 'Bart', so that Hedgematic can invoke a `buy` transaction.)

1. Copy the  `buy2.js` client application script from the `commpaper` repo directory into the current `commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application` directory for now (make sure to insert the dot '.' in the command below):

`cp $HOME/commpaper/buy2.js . `

2. Copy the file 'wallet.zip' from the `commpaper` repo directory, into the `/tmp` directory. Then unzip it, example shown below:


`cp $HOME/commpaper/wallet.zip /tmp`

`cd /tmp`

`unzip wallet.zip`

It will unzip the user bart's wallet into a subdirectory under `/tmp/wallet`. After extraction, you will have a directory `/tmp/wallet/bart@hedgematic` containing `Bart@Hedgematic's` identity wallet.

3. Now run the 2nd buy transaction (its using Bart's identity in the client application `buy2.js`) as follows:

`node buy2.js`

You should get messages confirming it was successful:

**Figure 7. The "2nd buy" transaction**
![The "2nd buy" transaction](images/buy-output2.png)

#### Transaction #4: Execute a `redeem` transaction as Bart@Hedgematic - six months later

The time has come, in this Commercial Paper's lifecycle, for the Commercial paper to be redeemed by its current owner (Hedgematic), and at face value, so it recoups its investment outlay. There is a client application, called `redeem.js` which will perform this task, and it needs to use `bart@hedgematic's` identity from owner Hegematic, to perform it (currently the `redeem.js` sample script uses `balaji's` identity, but because Hedgematic have since bought the paper from DigiBank, we need to modify the JS script to redeem it properly as Hedgematic's Bart !). For the purposes of this tutorial, we will simply run the client application script for `redeem` from the `digibank` application subdirectory.

1. Once again from a terminal window, and the same directory `$HOME/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application` - edit the file `redeem.js`

2. Change line 25 approx. - beginning with `const wallet =` , to read as follows: (you may prefer to copy the line, and comment the original using `//` - the wallet points to the downloaded wallet directory as shown below):

`const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('/tmp/wallet');`   

(Or if you prefer, you can issue your own identity, using the currently active CA server, using the Fabric-CA utilities or APIs and change this JS script as appropriate).

3. Change line 38 approx beginning with `const userName =` to read as follows (you may prefer to copy the existing line, and comment the original line, using `//` ) - so the userName points to bart, the employee of Hedgematic:

`const userName = 'bart@hedgematic';`

(Or if you prefer, you can issue your own identity, using the currently active CA server, using the Fabric-CA utilities or APIs and change this JS script as appropriate).

4. Finally, change line 67 approx beginning with `const redeemResponse` and change the FOURTH parameter to become 'Hedgematic' :

` const redeemResponse = await contract.submitTransaction('redeem', 'MagnetoCorp', '00001', 'Hedgematic', '2020-11-30')`

All good - save your file (CONTROL and S) and commit any changes.


5. Now run the `redeem.js` script :

`node redeem.js`

You should get messages confirming it was successful:

**Figure 8. The "redeem" transaction -- the last in the lifecycle**
![The "redeem" transaction](images/redeem-output.png)


### Step 6. Launch the sample DigiBank Client query application

1. From a terminal window, change directory to the `$HOME/fabric-samples/commercial-paper/organization/digibank/application` folder

2. Run the queryapp client using node:

`node queryapp.js`

3. You should see the JSON results from both the `queryHist` function and `queryOwner` functions in the terminal window. It also creates a file  called `results.json` in the current directory (history of the asset) as a result of the `queryHist` query invocation.

**Figure 9. The "queryapp" client results **
![The "queryapp" client results](images/queryapp-results.png)

### Step 7. Display the History in a nice HTML-based UI

For this part, we'll use a simple Tabulator that will render our results in a nice HTML table. For more info on Tabulator, see http://tabulator.info/examples/4.1 . We don't have to install any code or client per se, nor use jquery - we just need to use a simple HTML file - it uses online CSS formatting and it performs a local `XMLHttpRequest() GET REST API` call to load the local results (from the JSON file, avoiding CORS issues) and render it in the table. That `index.html` file comes from the `commpaper` Github repo that was cloned previously, please take time to peruse the HTML file. INFO: Note that this HTML file is provided 'as-is' and purely for the purposes of rendering in a FIREFOX browser (at the time of writing, some of the javascript (it doesn't use jquery by the way) formatting does not work in Chrome (doesn't like forEach !), but has been tested in Firefox).

1. In a terminal window, open the digibank `application` directory once again (you should already be there). 

2. Copy the file `index.html` from the `commpaper` repo (cloned earlier) into it. Eg. (with trailing '.' below, for current dir):

`cp $HOME/commpaper/index.html . `

If you examine the HTML file in VScode Explorer, it performs a `REST /GET API` call and loads a results file called `results.json` (created by the queries app invoked earlier) and render these in a table in a browser. The `results.json` contains the query results.

3. Launch a Firefox browser session (see note earlier), providing the `index.html` file provided as a parameter - tested with Firefox eg.

`firefox index.html`

4. You should see the results in tabular form in the browser - expand or contract column widths as it suits, such as longer columns like `Invoking ID` etc - note that `TxId` here, is the Fabric transaction Id. The `Invoking ID` is the invoker Common Name, which is extracted using the Client Identity library mentioned earlier. Obviously, it would need to be made available as an attribute by any of the organisations executing transactions using this shared smart contract. . Alternatives may be a hash of the signer certificate that was used to perform each transaction.

Well done! You've completed the query tutorial for adding query functionality to the Commercial Paper sample smart contract using the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode extension.

## Conclusion

You have learned how to add queries and upgrade your existing Commercial paper contract using the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode extension, and use features from Hyperledger Fabric's new programming model.  Take time to peruse the transaction (query) functions in both `papercontract.js` and the Query class file `query.js` under the `lib` directory. Also, take time to peruse the client application `queryapp.js`.

Finally, you've shown how to render the history results - ie history of a Commercial Paper asset - in a simple browser-based HTML application. The final tutorial (which is based on this), will be to show only 'deltas' or changes during the lifecycle.

As a last step, it is good practice to close out your current folders in VSCode, in preparation for the next tutorial - adding smart contract functionality to query only the 'deltas' for the history of a particular asset - this will be the 3rd tutorial in the series

Thank you for completing this!
